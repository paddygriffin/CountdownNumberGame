# CountdownNumberGame
A countdown number game for theory of algorithmns project using functional programming

### Algorithm 
I used remove-duplicates built in function to remove repeated statements in order
to make the problem smaller. And then working on making it a valid RPN.

Map adds two numbers to start of all permutations and adds one operator to the end of permutations

Working on checking if a function is valid for RPN and need to apply the function to 
every element of the list/stack and some equations are still not valid from my code. Also
remove-duplicates cant get inside nested lists.
